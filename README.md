# CS-210
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
//This project required the ability to code a banking app that allowed users to watch their investments grow over time.
What did you do particularly well?
// I did a great job on creating a functional program, that contained a menu to show the compound intrest prices of an ivestment.
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
// I could have improved  my code by using pointers. This would have allowed increased performance when retrieving data from customer.
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
//I thought the most challenging pieces of code to write were the different classes for app. Making sure notating the right ones were void. To get help with this I had to look at stack overflow for help when knowing where to put things in order so it can be read write in the complier.
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
//Being more comfortable with different classes, Using math functions and creating menus with loops have helped me to tackle other work
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
// I done so with great coments and spaces. This allows the reader to see what I was trying to code and if there are any eerors
